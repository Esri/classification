# Classification

As a default administrator, you can assign your organization a classification schema that allows your members to classify items based on their level of sensitivity. Item classification helps organization members understand the extent of security and safeguarding an item warrants and thus can play a crucial role in protecting confidential and proprietary information. For example, a government agency can configure a classification schema that lets users assign strict classification and dissemination labels to classified items and later change those labels when the items can be declassified and released to the public. 

Assigning a classification schema to your organization requires a valid classification schema outlined in a JSON file. You can download the [simple](https://github.com/ArcGIS/classification/tree/main/simple%20classification%20schemas) and [intermediate](https://github.com/ArcGIS/classification/tree/main/intermediate%20classification%20schemas) classification schema samples provided in this repo and use them as a reference to create a classification schema that meets your organization's needs. For instructions on how to create classification schemas, see [Create classification schemas](https://github.com/ArcGIS/classification/blob/main/Create%20classification%20schemas.md).

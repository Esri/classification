# Classification

As a default administrator, you can assign your organization a classification schema that allows your members to classify items based on their level of sensitivity. Item classification helps organization members understand the extent of security and safeguarding an item warrants and thus can play a crucial role in protecting confidential and proprietary information. For example, a government agency can configure a classification schema that lets users assign strict classification and dissemination labels to classified items and later change those labels when the items can be declassified and released to the public. 

Before you can assign a classification schema to your organization, you must create it by defining the configuration options for the classification in a valid JSON file. This repository hosts simple and intermediate classification schema samples that you can use as a reference to create a classification schema that meets your organization's needs.
